    <h3 id="11">Html Basics</h3>
    <p>HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web Hypertext
        Application Technology Working Group, an organization formed by people working
        on the most popular web browser. This means it's basically controlled by Google,
        Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft.<br><br>
         In the past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organization in charge of
        creating the HTML standard.<br>
         The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the
        W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea.<br>

        <h3 id="12">Html version</h3>
        <p>We had HTML version 1 in 1993.<br>
             HTML 2 followed in 1995.<br>
             We got HTML 3 in January 1997, and HTML 4 in December 1997.<br>
             HTML5 is a term that now defines a whole set of technologies, which
            includes HTML but adds a lot of APIs and standards like WebGL, SVG,
            and more <br>

            <p>It can be generated by a server-side application that builds it depending on
                the request or the session data, for example, a Rails or Laravel, or Django
                application.<br>
                 It can be generated by a JavaScript client-side application that generates
                HTML on the fly.<br>
                 In the simplest case, it can be stored in a file and served to the browser by a
                Web server.<br><br>

                <h3 id="14">Html Page structure</h3>
                <p>Modern HTML uses this doctype:
                   <!-- <!DOCTYPE html>-->
                    Then we have the html element, which has an opening and closing tag:<br>
                    Most tags come in pairs with an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is written the same as
                    the opening tag, but with a /:<br>
                    There are a few self-closing tags, which means they don't need a separate closing tag as they don't
                    contain anything in them <br>
                    <img src="C:\Users\JEEVAN PRASATH.G\Desktop\html work\task1\images (2).png" alt="los" width="50%" height="30%">
                </p>
                <p id="top"><a href="#go">Go to Top</a></p>

                </div><br>
                    <div>
                    <h3 id="15">Tag vs element</h3>
                    <p>Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag. In this example, we use the p starting
                        and closing tags to create a p element:<br>
                        <p>A paragraph of text</p>
                        So, an element constitutes the whole package:
                         starting tag<br>
                         text content (and possibly other elements)
                         closing tag<br>
                        If an element has doesn't have a closing tag, it is only written with the starting tag, and it 
                        cannot contain any text content <br> <br>

                    </p>
                    <p id="top"><a href="#go">Go to Top</a></p>

                    </div>

                    <br>
                    <div>
                    <h3 id="16">Attributes</h3>
                        <p>The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach,
                            called attributes. Attributes have the key="value" syntax:<br>
                            <!--<p class="a-class">A paragraph of text</p>-->
                            The class and id attributes are two of the most common you will find used.
                            They have a special meaning, and they are useful both in CSS and JavaScript.
                            The difference between the two is that an id is unique in the context of a web page; it
                            cannot be duplicated. Classes, on the other hand, can appear multiple times on multiple
                            elements.<br>
                            Plus, an id is just one value. A class can hold multiple values, separated by a space.<br>

                        </p>
                        <p id="top"><a href="#go">Go to Top</a></p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 id="17">case insensitive</h3>
                        <p>HTML is case insensitive. Tags can be written in all caps, or lowercase.<br> In the
                            early days, caps were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm.<br> It is a
                            convention</p>
                            <p id="top"><a href="#go">Go to Top</a></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
